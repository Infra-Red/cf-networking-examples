# CF Networking Example Apps

This repo holds example apps to demonstrate [container networking](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-networking-release)
with and without [service discovery](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-networking-release/blob/develop/docs/app-sd.md) on Cloud Foundry.

To try out container networking without service discovery, [follow these
instructions](docs/c2c-no-service-discovery.md).

To try out container networking with service discovery, [follow these
instructions](docs/c2c-with-service-discovery.md).

For questions or feedback, chat with us at the `#container-networking` channel
on [Cloud Foundry Slack](http://slack.cloudfoundry.org/).
